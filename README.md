This is a Web API project, written in C#, using .Net 8 and interfacing directly to SQL Server through ADO.Net.
This API serves up the required data (and receives the same for new records/updated records) from the "RobotClient" project, which is an Angular 16.x project.
I have not made the matching Client project to be publicly available as is this Server project.
